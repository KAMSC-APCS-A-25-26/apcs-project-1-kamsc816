You begin as a slow runner. You have no speed, no stamina. There are ten days left before the state championship race. Each day, you have the opportunity to increase your speed and stamina, and also maintain energy. You are "training". Then, at the end of each day, you participate in a race, with different strategies available for the race. At the end of the 10 days, you complete one final day in which the state championship race occurs. After the state championship ends, you can either win, lose, or there is a secret ending if you made decisions during the day that allow for it. Good luck and have fun!
